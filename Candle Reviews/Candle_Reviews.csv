(Wish I'd gotten Christmas Cookie.) To me, the Balsam and Cedar is the stronger smelling, but it smells a little more like soap than like a forest or a Christmas tree! The Red Apple Wreath has a lovely scent, but it would have been nice if the scent were a little stronger.The candles do last quite a long time, and thankfully, they burn clean. No nasty dark marks on ceilings or walls. That is a very important point to me. I like the containers, but these candles are so large that you really need a barbecue lighter to light them once they burn down low.Overall, very nice candles that would have been perfect five stars had the scent been up to par, but it just wasn't. This is especially true of my favorite of the two, the Red Apple Wreath. It's so difficult to find a really good scented candle today, and, sadly, these don't really rise to the occasion.

165,"December 12, 2020",R1IN4Q0PUQESUT,Bob,1.0,"I have enjoyed Yankee Candles for many years. When I have burned them, I have enjoyed how they fill the space with a wonderful scent. In the past, if I burn the candle for a few hours, and then blow it out and leave the house, when I return, the scent still is lingering in the air. BUT NOT SO WITH THESE!!! Recently I ordered two of my favorite scent. When they arrived, the scent was barely detected. So - I thought this must be a produce defect. Because I love them so much, I returned them. (I rarely if ever return products.) I received two replacements very quickly. Thank you for the good service! HOWEVER, these candles have the same issue. I can burn them for hours and still not even smell the scent. Even when burning, if I hold the candle close, I only detect the very, very slightest scent. It is almost entirely undetectable. So now I again have two of my favorite, hard to find scents (Christmas Wreath), but do not have the pleasure of enjoying the scent of the candle. This is VERY disappointing! I wonder if Yankee Candle sells inferior products on Amazon? Would it be the same if I were shopping in their store??
